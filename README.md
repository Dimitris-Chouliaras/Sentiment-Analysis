🧠 Sentiment Analysis Web App

This project is an interactive Sentiment Analysis web application built with Python and Streamlit.
It allows users to analyze the sentiment of text data using two popular Natural Language Processing (NLP) models — TextBlob and NLTK (VADER).

*Text Analysis: Enter any text and instantly receive its polarity, subjectivity, and sentiment category (Positive, Neutral, or Negative).

*Text Cleaning: Remove unnecessary words, punctuation, numbers, and extra spaces to obtain a cleaner version of your text.

*CSV/Excel File Upload: Upload a .csv or .xlsx file containing sentences for batch sentiment analysis.

   Choose a column from your dataset for analysis.

   View the results directly in the app.

   Download the processed data as an Excel file.

*Model Selection: Choose between:

   TextBlob for polarity and subjectivity scoring.

   NLTK (VADER) for compound sentiment scoring.

*Custom Threshold: Adjust the threshold for defining Neutral/Positive/Negative sentiment.
