# Sentiment-Analysis
A Python program developed in PyCharm to demonstrate the basic Natural Language Processing techniques and their application using real-world text data. It evaluates the sentiment into 3 categories, positive/negative/neutral. It can either accept text on the spot from the user or the user can upload an excel/csv file to perform sentiment analysis.
